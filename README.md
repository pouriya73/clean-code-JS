# clean-code-JS
Software engineering principles, from Robert C. Martin's book Clean Code, adapted for JavaScript. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing readable, reusable, and refactorable software in JavaScript.


### Variables
Use meaningful and pronounceable variable names

#### Bad:
```javascript
const yyyymmdstr = moment().format("YYYY/MM/DD");
```
#### Good:
```javascript
const currentDate = moment().format("YYYY/MM/DD");
```

### Use the same vocabulary for the same type of variable

#### Bad:
```javascript
getUserInfo();
getClientData();
getCustomerRecord();
```
#### Good:
```javascript
getUser();
```

### We will read more code than we will ever write. It's important that the code we do write is readable and searchable. By not naming variables that end up being meaningful for understanding our program, we hurt our readers. Make your names searchable. Tools like buddy.js and ESLint can help identify unnamed constants.

#### Bad:
```javascript
// What the heck is 86400000 for?
setTimeout(blastOff, 86400000);
```
#### Good:
```javascript
// Declare them as capitalized named constants.
const MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY = 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000; //86400000;

setTimeout(blastOff, MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY);
```


### Use explanatory variables

#### Bad:
```javascript
const address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014";
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
saveCityZipCode(
  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[1],
  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[2]
);
```
#### Good:
```javascript
const address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014";
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
const [_, city, zipCode] = address.match(cityZipCodeRegex) || [];
saveCityZipCode(city, zipCode);
```



### Avoid Mental Mapping , Explicit is better than implicit.

#### Bad:
```javascript
const locations = ["Austin", "New York", "San Francisco"];
locations.forEach(l => {
  doStuff();
  doSomeOtherStuff();
  // ...
  // ...
  // ...
  // Wait, what is `l` for again?
  dispatch(l);
});
```
#### Good:
```javascript
const locations = ["Austin", "New York", "San Francisco"];
locations.forEach(location => {
  doStuff();
  doSomeOtherStuff();
  // ...
  // ...
  // ...
  dispatch(location);
});
```


### Don't add unneeded context, If your class/object name tells you something, don't repeat that in your variable name.

#### Bad:
```javascript
const Car = {
  carMake: "Honda",
  carModel: "Accord",
  carColor: "Blue"
};

function paintCar(car, color) {
  car.carColor = color;
}
});
```
#### Good:
```javascript
const Car = {
  make: "Honda",
  model: "Accord",
  color: "Blue"
};

function paintCar(car, color) {
  car.color = color;
}
```

### Use default arguments instead of short circuiting or conditionals
Default arguments are often cleaner than short circuiting. Be aware that if you use them, your function will only provide default values for undefined arguments. Other "falsy" values such as '', "", false, null, 0, and NaN, will not be replaced by a default value.

#### Bad:
```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name) {
  const breweryName = name || "Hipster Brew Co.";
  // ...
}
```
#### Good:
```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name = "Hipster Brew Co.") {
  // ...
}
```

### Function arguments (2 or fewer ideally)
Limiting the amount of function parameters is incredibly important because it makes testing your function easier. Having more than three leads to a combinatorial explosion where you have to test tons of different cases with each separate argument.

One or two arguments is the ideal case, and three should be avoided if possible. Anything more than that should be consolidated. Usually, if you have more than two arguments then your function is trying to do too much. In cases where it's not, most of the time a higher-level object will suffice as an argument.

Since JavaScript allows you to make objects on the fly, without a lot of class boilerplate, you can use an object if you are finding yourself needing a lot of arguments.

To make it obvious what properties the function expects, you can use the ES2015/ES6 destructuring syntax. This has a few advantages:

When someone looks at the function signature, it's immediately clear what properties are being used.
It can be used to simulate named parameters.
Destructuring also clones the specified primitive values of the argument object passed into the function. This can help prevent side effects. Note: objects and arrays that are destructured from the argument object are NOT cloned.
Linters can warn you about unused properties, which would be impossible without destructuring.


#### Bad:
```javascript
function createMenu(title, body, buttonText, cancellable) {
  // ...
}

createMenu("Foo", "Bar", "Baz", true);
}
```
#### Good:
```javascript
function createMenu({ title, body, buttonText, cancellable }) {
  // ...
}

createMenu({
  title: "Foo",
  body: "Bar",
  buttonText: "Baz",
  cancellable: true
});
}
```




### Functions should do one thing
This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions do more than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about. When you can isolate a function to just one action, it can be refactored easily and your code will read much cleaner. If you take nothing else away from this guide other than this, you'll be ahead of many developers.


#### Bad:
```javascript
function emailClients(clients) {
  clients.forEach(client => {
    const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
    if (clientRecord.isActive()) {
      email(client);
    }
  });
}
```
#### Good:
```javascript
function emailActiveClients(clients) {
  clients.filter(isActiveClient).forEach(email);
}

function isActiveClient(client) {
  const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
  return clientRecord.isActive();
}
}
```




### Function names should say what they do


#### Bad:
```javascript
function addToDate(date, month) {
  // ...
}

const date = new Date();

// It's hard to tell from the function name what is added
addToDate(date, 1);
}
```
#### Good:
```javascript
function addMonthToDate(month, date) {
  // ...
}

const date = new Date();
addMonthToDate(1, date);
```




### Functions should only be one level of abstraction
When you have more than one level of abstraction your function is usually doing too much. Splitting up functions leads to reusability and easier testing.


#### Bad:
```javascript
function parseBetterJSAlternative(code) {
  const REGEXES = [
    // ...
  ];

  const statements = code.split(" ");
  const tokens = [];
  REGEXES.forEach(REGEX => {
    statements.forEach(statement => {
      // ...
    });
  });

  const ast = [];
  tokens.forEach(token => {
    // lex...
  });

  ast.forEach(node => {
    // parse...
  });
}
```
#### Good:
```javascript
function parseBetterJSAlternative(code) {
  const tokens = tokenize(code);
  const syntaxTree = parse(tokens);
  syntaxTree.forEach(node => {
    // parse...
  });
}

function tokenize(code) {
  const REGEXES = [
    // ...
  ];

  const statements = code.split(" ");
  const tokens = [];
  REGEXES.forEach(REGEX => {
    statements.forEach(statement => {
      tokens.push(/* ... */);
    });
  });

  return tokens;
}

function parse(tokens) {
  const syntaxTree = [];
  tokens.forEach(token => {
    syntaxTree.push(/* ... */);
  });

  return syntaxTree;
}
```



### Remove duplicate code
Do your absolute best to avoid duplicate code. Duplicate code is bad because it means that there's more than one place to alter something if you need to change some logic.

Imagine if you run a restaurant and you keep track of your inventory: all your tomatoes, onions, garlic, spices, etc. If you have multiple lists that you keep this on, then all have to be updated when you serve a dish with tomatoes in them. If you only have one list, there's only one place to update!

Oftentimes you have duplicate code because you have two or more slightly different things, that share a lot in common, but their differences force you to have two or more separate functions that do much of the same things. Removing duplicate code means creating an abstraction that can handle this set of different things with just one function/module/class.

Getting the abstraction right is critical, that's why you should follow the SOLID principles laid out in the Classes section. Bad abstractions can be worse than duplicate code, so be careful! Having said this, if you can make a good abstraction, do it! Don't repeat yourself, otherwise you'll find yourself updating multiple places anytime you want to change one thing.

#### Bad:
```javascript
function showDeveloperList(developers) {
  developers.forEach(developer => {
    const expectedSalary = developer.calculateExpectedSalary();
    const experience = developer.getExperience();
    const githubLink = developer.getGithubLink();
    const data = {
      expectedSalary,
      experience,
      githubLink
    };

    render(data);
  });
}

function showManagerList(managers) {
  managers.forEach(manager => {
    const expectedSalary = manager.calculateExpectedSalary();
    const experience = manager.getExperience();
    const portfolio = manager.getMBAProjects();
    const data = {
      expectedSalary,
      experience,
      portfolio
    };

    render(data);
  });
}
```
#### Good:
```javascript
function showEmployeeList(employees) {
  employees.forEach(employee => {
    const expectedSalary = employee.calculateExpectedSalary();
    const experience = employee.getExperience();

    const data = {
      expectedSalary,
      experience
    };

    switch (employee.type) {
      case "manager":
        data.portfolio = employee.getMBAProjects();
        break;
      case "developer":
        data.githubLink = employee.getGithubLink();
        break;
    }

    render(data);
  });
}
```


### Set default objects with Object.assign

#### Bad:
```javascript
const menuConfig = {
  title: null,
  body: "Bar",
  buttonText: null,
  cancellable: true
};

function createMenu(config) {
  config.title = config.title || "Foo";
  config.body = config.body || "Bar";
  config.buttonText = config.buttonText || "Baz";
  config.cancellable =
    config.cancellable !== undefined ? config.cancellable : true;
}

createMenu(menuConfig);
```
#### Good:
```javascript
const menuConfig = {
  title: "Order",
  // User did not include 'body' key
  buttonText: "Send",
  cancellable: true
};

function createMenu(config) {
  let finalConfig = Object.assign(
    {
      title: "Foo",
      body: "Bar",
      buttonText: "Baz",
      cancellable: true
    },
    config
  );
  return finalConfig
  // config now equals: {title: "Order", body: "Bar", buttonText: "Send", cancellable: true}
  // ...
}

createMenu(menuConfig);
```



### Don't use flags as function parameters
Flags tell your user that this function does more than one thing. Functions should do one thing. Split out your functions if they are following different code paths based on a boolean.

#### Bad:
```javascript
function createFile(name, temp) {
  if (temp) {
    fs.create(`./temp/${name}`);
  } else {
    fs.create(name);
  }
}
```
#### Good:
```javascript
function createFile(name) {
  fs.create(name);
}

function createTempFile(name) {
  createFile(`./temp/${name}`);
}
```


### Avoid Side Effects (part 1)
A function produces a side effect if it does anything other than take a value in and return another value or values. A side effect could be writing to a file, modifying some global variable, or accidentally wiring all your money to a stranger.

Now, you do need to have side effects in a program on occasion. Like the previous example, you might need to write to a file. What you want to do is to centralize where you are doing this. Don't have several functions and classes that write to a particular file. Have one service that does it. One and only one.

The main point is to avoid common pitfalls like sharing state between objects without any structure, using mutable data types that can be written to by anything, and not centralizing where your side effects occur. If you can do this, you will be happier than the vast majority of other programmers.



#### Bad:
```javascript
// Global variable referenced by following function.
// If we had another function that used this name, now it'd be an array and it could break it.
let name = "Ryan McDermott";

function splitIntoFirstAndLastName() {
  name = name.split(" ");
}

splitIntoFirstAndLastName();

console.log(name); // ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];
```
#### Good:
```javascript
function splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name) {
  return name.split(" ");
}

const name = "Ryan McDermott";
const newName = splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name);

console.log(name); // 'Ryan McDermott';
console.log(newName); // ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];
```




### Avoid Side Effects (part 2)
In JavaScript, some values are unchangeable (immutable) and some are changeable (mutable). Objects and arrays are two kinds of mutable values so it's important to handle them carefully when they're passed as parameters to a function. A JavaScript function can change an object's properties or alter the contents of an array which could easily cause bugs elsewhere.

Suppose there's a function that accepts an array parameter representing a shopping cart. If the function makes a change in that shopping cart array - by adding an item to purchase, for example - then any other function that uses that same cart array will be affected by this addition. That may be great, however it could also be bad. Let's imagine a bad situation:

The user clicks the "Purchase" button which calls a purchase function that spawns a network request and sends the cart array to the server. Because of a bad network connection, the purchase function has to keep retrying the request. Now, what if in the meantime the user accidentally clicks an "Add to Cart" button on an item they don't actually want before the network request begins? If that happens and the network request begins, then that purchase function will send the accidentally added item because the cart array was modified.

A great solution would be for the addItemToCart function to always clone the cart, edit it, and return the clone. This would ensure that functions that are still using the old shopping cart wouldn't be affected by the changes.

Two caveats to mention to this approach:

There might be cases where you actually want to modify the input object, but when you adopt this programming practice you will find that those cases are pretty rare. Most things can be refactored to have no side effects!

Cloning big objects can be very expensive in terms of performance. Luckily, this isn't a big issue in practice because there are great libraries that allow this kind of programming approach to be fast and not as memory intensive as it would be for you to manually clone objects and arrays.



#### Bad:
```javascript
const addItemToCart = (cart, item) => {
  cart.push({ item, date: Date.now() });
};
```
#### Good:
```javascript
const addItemToCart = (cart, item) => {
  return [...cart, { item, date: Date.now() }];
};
```



### Don't write to global functions
Polluting globals is a bad practice in JavaScript because you could clash with another library and the user of your API would be none-the-wiser until they get an exception in production. Let's think about an example: what if you wanted to extend JavaScript's native Array method to have a diff method that could show the difference between two arrays? You could write your new function to the Array.prototype, but it could clash with another library that tried to do the same thing. What if that other library was just using diff to find the difference between the first and last elements of an array? This is why it would be much better to just use ES2015/ES6 classes and simply extend the Array global.


#### Bad:
```javascript
Array.prototype.diff = function diff(comparisonArray) {
  const hash = new Set(comparisonArray);
  return this.filter(elem => !hash.has(elem));
};
```
#### Good:
```javascript
class SuperArray extends Array {
  diff(comparisonArray) {
    const hash = new Set(comparisonArray);
    return this.filter(elem => !hash.has(elem));
  }
}
```

### Favor functional programming over imperative programming
JavaScript isn't a functional language in the way that Haskell is, but it has a functional flavor to it. Functional languages can be cleaner and easier to test. Favor this style of programming when you can.



#### Bad:
```javascript
const programmerOutput = [
  {
    name: "Uncle Bobby",
    linesOfCode: 500
  },
  {
    name: "Suzie Q",
    linesOfCode: 1500
  },
  {
    name: "Jimmy Gosling",
    linesOfCode: 150
  },
  {
    name: "Gracie Hopper",
    linesOfCode: 1000
  }
];

let totalOutput = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < programmerOutput.length; i++) {
  totalOutput += programmerOutput[i].linesOfCode;
}
```
#### Good:
```javascript
const programmerOutput = [
  {
    name: "Uncle Bobby",
    linesOfCode: 500
  },
  {
    name: "Suzie Q",
    linesOfCode: 1500
  },
  {
    name: "Jimmy Gosling",
    linesOfCode: 150
  },
  {
    name: "Gracie Hopper",
    linesOfCode: 1000
  }
];

const totalOutput = programmerOutput.reduce(
  (totalLines, output) => totalLines + output.linesOfCode,
  0
);
```

### Encapsulate conditionals



#### Bad:
```javascript
if (fsm.state === "fetching" && isEmpty(listNode)) {
  // ...
}
```
#### Good:
```javascript
function shouldShowSpinner(fsm, listNode) {
  return fsm.state === "fetching" && isEmpty(listNode);
}

if (shouldShowSpinner(fsmInstance, listNodeInstance)) {
  // ...
}
```



### Avoid negative conditionals



#### Bad:
```javascript
function isDOMNodeNotPresent(node) {
  // ...
}

if (!isDOMNodeNotPresent(node)) {
  // ...
}
```
#### Good:
```javascript
function isDOMNodePresent(node) {
  // ...
}

if (isDOMNodePresent(node)) {
  // ...
}
```



### Avoid conditionals
This seems like an impossible task. Upon first hearing this, most people say, "how am I supposed to do anything without an if statement?" The answer is that you can use polymorphism to achieve the same task in many cases. The second question is usually, "well that's great but why would I want to do that?" The answer is a previous clean code concept we learned: a function should only do one thing. When you have classes and functions that have if statements, you are telling your user that your function does more than one thing. Remember, just do one thing.


#### Bad:
```javascript
class Airplane {
  // ...
  getCruisingAltitude() {
    switch (this.type) {
      case "777":
        return this.getMaxAltitude() - this.getPassengerCount();
      case "Air Force One":
        return this.getMaxAltitude();
      case "Cessna":
        return this.getMaxAltitude() - this.getFuelExpenditure();
    }
  }
}
```
#### Good:
```javascript
class Airplane {
  // ...
}

class Boeing777 extends Airplane {
  // ...
  getCruisingAltitude() {
    return this.getMaxAltitude() - this.getPassengerCount();
  }
}

class AirForceOne extends Airplane {
  // ...
  getCruisingAltitude() {
    return this.getMaxAltitude();
  }
}

class Cessna extends Airplane {
  // ...
  getCruisingAltitude() {
    return this.getMaxAltitude() - this.getFuelExpenditure();
  }
}
```



### Avoid type-checking (part 1)
JavaScript is untyped, which means your functions can take any type of argument. Sometimes you are bitten by this freedom and it becomes tempting to do type-checking in your functions. There are many ways to avoid having to do this. The first thing to consider is consistent APIs.


#### Bad:
```javascript
function travelToTexas(vehicle) {
  if (vehicle instanceof Bicycle) {
    vehicle.pedal(this.currentLocation, new Location("texas"));
  } else if (vehicle instanceof Car) {
    vehicle.drive(this.currentLocation, new Location("texas"));
  }
}
```
#### Good:
```javascript
function travelToTexas(vehicle) {
  vehicle.move(this.currentLocation, new Location("texas"));
}
```


### Avoid type-checking (part 2)
If you are working with basic primitive values like strings and integers, and you can't use polymorphism but you still feel the need to type-check, you should consider using TypeScript. It is an excellent alternative to normal JavaScript, as it provides you with static typing on top of standard JavaScript syntax. The problem with manually type-checking normal JavaScript is that doing it well requires so much extra verbiage that the faux "type-safety" you get doesn't make up for the lost readability. Keep your JavaScript clean, write good tests, and have good code reviews. Otherwise, do all of that but with TypeScript (which, like I said, is a great alternative!).


#### Bad:
```javascript
function combine(val1, val2) {
  if (
    (typeof val1 === "number" && typeof val2 === "number") ||
    (typeof val1 === "string" && typeof val2 === "string")
  ) {
    return val1 + val2;
  }

  throw new Error("Must be of type String or Number");
}
```
#### Good:
```javascript
function combine(val1, val2) {
  return val1 + val2;
}
```



### Don't over-optimize
Modern browsers do a lot of optimization under-the-hood at runtime. A lot of times, if you are optimizing then you are just wasting your time. There are good resources for seeing where optimization is lacking. Target those in the meantime, until they are fixed if they can be.


#### Bad:
```javascript
// On old browsers, each iteration with uncached `list.length` would be costly
// because of `list.length` recomputation. In modern browsers, this is optimized.
for (let i = 0, len = list.length; i < len; i++) {
  // ...
}
```
#### Good:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
  // ...
}
```



### Remove dead code
Dead code is just as bad as duplicate code. There's no reason to keep it in your codebase. If it's not being called, get rid of it! It will still be safe in your version history if you still need it.


#### Bad:
```javascript
function oldRequestModule(url) {
  // ...
}

function newRequestModule(url) {
  // ...
}

const req = newRequestModule;
inventoryTracker("apples", req, "www.inventory-awesome.io");
```
#### Good:
```javascript
function newRequestModule(url) {
  // ...
}

const req = newRequestModule;
inventoryTracker("apples", req, "www.inventory-awesome.io");
```




### Objects and Data Structures
Use getters and setters
Using getters and setters to access data on objects could be better than simply looking for a property on an object. "Why?" you might ask. Well, here's an unorganized list of reasons why:

When you want to do more beyond getting an object property, you don't have to look up and change every accessor in your codebase.
Makes adding validation simple when doing a set.
Encapsulates the internal representation.
Easy to add logging and error handling when getting and setting.



#### Bad:
```javascript
function makeBankAccount() {
  // ...

  return {
    balance: 0
    // ...
  };
}

const account = makeBankAccount();
account.balance = 100;
```
#### Good:
```javascript
function makeBankAccount() {
  // this one is private
  let balance = 0;

  // a "getter", made public via the returned object below
  function getBalance() {
    return balance;
  }

  // a "setter", made public via the returned object below
  function setBalance(amount) {
    // ... validate before updating the balance
    balance = amount;
  }

  return {
    // ...
    getBalance,
    setBalance
  };
}

const account = makeBankAccount();
account.setBalance(100);
```
